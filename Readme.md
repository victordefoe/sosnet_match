This is an unoffical implementation of CVPR 2019 accepted paper "SOSNet: Second Order Similarity Regularization for Local Descriptor Learning" , and because of the training process was not public, I will try to follow with my understanding and use it in our dataset.

## Task
Our goal is to verfiy the ability of "cross source Matching" of SOSNet in Remote sensing situation. 

## Dataset
dataset introduction:
training data Collection-10000 is a synthetic dataset with nearly 10,000 image from Google Earth Software.

test dataset named "Collection_1" (aka Collection-850) contain 850 synthetic images.
test dataset named "NWPU-ChangAn" is the real-world dataset with nearly 150 photo.

we test there ability of matching with historical satellite image.
